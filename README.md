# fychao.github.io

This repository is a minimal Vue 3 + Vite site intended as an academic homepage and is set up to deploy to GitHub Pages via Actions.

Quick start

```bash
# install
npm install

# run dev server
npm run dev

# build for production
npm run build
```

Notes
- The GitHub Actions workflow builds the site and deploys the `dist` folder to GitHub Pages when you push to `master`.
- Update `src/App.vue` with your real information, publications, and contact details.
